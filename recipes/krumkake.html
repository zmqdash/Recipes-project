    <h2>Description</h2>
    Krumkake (pronounced KROOM-ka-ka) is a traditional Norwegian cookie, often enjoyed during the Christmas season. The name translates to "curved cake", though it's typically considered a type of cookie. 
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul><li>flour</li><li>sugar</li><li>salt</li><li>eggs</li><li>milk</li><li>butter</li><li>water</li><li>vanilla extract</li><li>cornstarch</li></ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol><li>Whisk the dry ingredients together in a medium bowl.  Set aside.</li><li>Combine the sugar and eggs in a large bowl and whisk until fully combined. Add the cooled melted butter and vanilla extract. Keep whisking until the mixture is emulsified and cohesive.</li><li>Add milk and water and whisk until fully combined. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk until the batter is smooth and no lumps remain. Rest batter for 30-45 minutes at room temperature. This rest period greatly improves the crispiness and light texture of the final product.</li><li>Working with 1 tablespoon of batter at a time, bake the cookies on a krumkake iron according to manufacturerâ€™s instructions.  It may take a few tries to get the hang of how your iron works so be patient. I like to err on the side of a cookie that is darker in color. They are more crisp and have better flavor.</li><li>Remove the hot cookie from iron and place it on a clean kitchen towel.  Quickly, while the cookie is still hot, carefully roll the krumkake around a cone-shaped form. Use the towel to help start the rolling process if the cookies are too hot for your fingers. The sooner you begin rolling the better.  The cookies will almost immediately start to harden as they cool and become difficult or impossible to roll into a cone shape. Let the rolled cookie rest with the form inside, seam side down on the clean towel, while the next cookie is baking.</li><li>Remove the cone form and transfer krumkake to a wire rack to cool completely. Repeat with remaining batter.</li></ol>
